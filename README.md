# KindleShareParser
If the `share` functionality doesn't work on your kindle, then any highlight you try to share will cause an email to be sent to you with an error and the content of the highlight. This is a script to extract the contents of those highlights into a text file

To use:

- collect all text from emails (simpel copy all the whole page will do)
- compile into a single text file
- navigate to directory of that text file in command line
- call python3 kindle_parser.py *name of text file* > *name of destination file*
